# nu-cli
Command Line tools build to operate NU Sci services

### Features
- Easily build and manage Docker containers within a unified Docker-compose project with one command.
- Automatically distribute `.env` files across different repositories.
- Conveniently switch between testing, connected, remote and other Docker environments.
- Visualize the status of all linked services.

### Usage
- The target repository must have a `nucli.config.json` in the root directory with the defined service in it. 
- In a terminal in the root directory, run the command `nucli link` to link this service to the cli.
  - In theory you can just run `nucli env <environment> [database]`, but to get the default experience, run `nucli link` first.
- From here, you may notice a `.env` file in the root directory. This is automatically generated by the nu-cli.
- Your Docker-compose project with the service's container(s) will be automatically generated.
- You can run `nucli env <environment> [database]` to change the running environment of the particular service you want to change.
- You can run `nucli unlink` to remove the entire Docker-compose project.

### Commands
- `nucli link`
- `nucli unlink`
- `nucli env <environment> [database]`
- `nucli status`

### Valid Commands
- For the backend service `<environment>` can be `testing`, `connected` with `[database]` option as either nothing or `remote`.
